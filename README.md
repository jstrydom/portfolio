This porject outlines the development of a specialized model for ChickenGuard, a backyard surveillance system designed to protect chickens from wild animal threats. The model leverages transfer learning with EfficientNetV2B0, employing Bayesian optimization to refine its architecture. A unique dataset, crafted through logical analysis of animal labels, underpins the ChickenGuard classification pipeline, enabling accurate identification of potential dangers to chickens.
