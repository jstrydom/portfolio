<a href="https://github.com/jstrydom/portfolio/blob/main/Backyard%20Camera%20Vision%20Classificication.ipynb" target="_blank">Github</a> 

This project outlines the development of a specialized model for ChickenGuard, a backyard surveillance system designed to protect chickens from wild animal threats. The model leverages transfer learning with EfficientNetV2B0, employing Bayesian optimization to refine its architecture. A unique dataset, crafted through logical analysis of animal labels, underpins the ChickenGuard classification pipeline, enabling accurate identification of potential dangers to chickens. Data is propietary and closed source.

### Transaction Flagging System for Fraudulent Transactions Exceeding €1000
<a href="https://github.com/jstrydom/portfolio/blob/main/Fraud%20Detection%20Report%20Jan%20Strydom%20.pdf" target="_blank">Report</a> <br>

This project explores the development of a system to flag fraudulent transactions over €1000. Utilizing a dataset of credit card transactions, various data mining techniques were applied to identify key variables that indicate fraudulent activity. The focus is on selecting simple, linearly related variables suitable for a regulatory-compliant, logic-based flagging system.
